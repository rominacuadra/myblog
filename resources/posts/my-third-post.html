<h1>My third article</h1>

<p>The language of an article depends upon the purpose and audience; usually,
    the vocabulary of the article will fit the topic content, and who it is targeted at.
    For example, you would expect an article about a recent film release to include the vocabulary of actors, scripts
    and performance.
